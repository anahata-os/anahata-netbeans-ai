**Title:** I built an AI assistant that is deeply integrated into the NetBeans IDE

**Body:**

Hey everyone,

I wanted to share an open-source project I've been working on: the **Anahata AI Assistant for Apache NetBeans**.

I've always felt that most AI coding assistants lack true context. They don't really *understand* your workspace. To solve this, I built a plugin that gives the AI (Google Gemini) direct, programmatic access to the IDE itself.

On every single request, the assistant knows:
- All your open projects and their file structures.
- Which files are currently open in the editor.
- A complete list of IDE errors and warnings.

This allows it to do some cool things, like building a project, reading a file, or reasoning about compilation errors with a simple natural language instruction. It's not just sending code snippets back and forth; it's interacting with the IDE's own systems.

The project is named "Anahata" (the heart chakra) to reflect the goal of creating a more harmonious and intuitive coding experience.

It's still early days, but I'd love for the community to check it out, give feedback, or even contribute.

Thanks for taking a look!
