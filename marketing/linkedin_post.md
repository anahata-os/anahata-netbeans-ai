**Title:** Introducing the Anahata AI Assistant: A New Era of Development in Apache NetBeans

**Body:**

Hello everyone,

I'm excited to introduce the Anahata AI Assistant, a new open-source plugin for Apache NetBeans that redefines the relationship between developers and AI.

For too long, AI coding assistants have felt like disconnected chatbots in a sidebar. They lack true context. We decided to solve this by building a plugin that gives the AI (powered by Google Gemini) direct, programmatic access to the IDE's core functionalities.

**What makes Anahata different?**

- **Deep Context Awareness:** It knows your open projects, active files, and even sees IDE errors and warnings in real-time. This isn't a simulation; it's a direct connection to the IDE's state.
- **Direct IDE Interaction:** You can instruct it to perform actions like 'build project' or 'run file', and it will execute them, bridging the gap between natural language and developer workflow.
- **Full Project Comprehension:** By reading your source files, it builds a genuine understanding of your codebase, leading to more accurate and insightful assistance.

Our philosophy is "Code from the Heart." The name "Anahata" refers to the heart chakra, symbolizing harmony and connection. We aim to create a seamless, intuitive workflow where the AI works in harmony with you, helping you stay in the creative flow.

Check out the project on GitHub to learn more and try it out. We welcome feedback and contributions from the community!
