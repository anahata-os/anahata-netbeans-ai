# Commercial Licensing for anahata-ai

This project is available under a dual-license model to support both the open-source community and professional enterprise needs.

While the `anahata-ai` framework and the Anahata NetBeans Plugin are open-source under the GNU AGPLv3, this license is designed to ensure that derivative works also remain open. This may not be suitable for organizations wishing to integrate our powerful AI engine into proprietary, closed-source commercial applications.

## The Professional Advantage: Beyond the Code

For professional teams, a commercial license provides the freedom to innovate and the expert support to succeed. It allows you to leverage Anahata's full potential without the copyleft obligations of the AGPLv3.

A commercial license is a partnership that grants you:
-   **The Right to Integrate:** Secure the legal rights to embed the `anahata-ai` engine into your proprietary applications, services, and internal development tools.
-   **Priority Support:** Gain direct access to the core development team for expert guidance, troubleshooting, and best practices.
-   **Customization & Integration:** Commission the development of custom AI tools, context providers, and bespoke integrations tailored to your specific workflow and technology stack.
-   **Influence the Roadmap:** Have a direct say in the future development and feature prioritization of the `anahata-ai` framework.

Our deep IDE integration and context-aware tooling provide a significant competitive advantage. By licensing `anahata-ai`, you can bring that power to your own organization.
