# 🚀 Anahata AI Assistant for NetBeans: Code from the Heart

**Elevate your coding experience with a true AI partner that understands your workflow.**

Anahata is an unprecedented, deeply integrated AI assistant for the Apache NetBeans IDE, powered by Google's Gemini models. It's more than a chatbot—it's a harmonious extension of your creative process, designed to bring flow and intelligence directly to your work.

## ✨ Why Anahata is the Future of IDE Assistance

Traditional AI assistants are disconnected. Anahata is built from the ground up to be a native part of your IDE, giving it unparalleled context and capability.

### 1. Deep, Real-Time Context Awareness (The Architectural Advantage)

Anahata doesn't guess. On every request, it receives a live, structured data payload that includes:

-   **Live Diagnostics:** Real-time visibility into all **IDE errors and warnings** across your open projects. Ask it to fix a compilation error, and it knows exactly where to look.
-   **Full Project Structure:** A complete overview of all open projects, their file structures, and the status of files in the conversation context.
-   **Editor State:** A list of all files currently open in the editor.

### 2. Programmatic IDE Control (Tools)

Anahata can execute high-level IDE actions with a simple natural language command:

| Feature | Description | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Project Actions** | Invoke `build`, `run`, `clean`, and other project actions directly. | **Accelerate your workflow** by eliminating manual clicks. |
| **Code Modification** | Use the `proposeChange` tool to receive code patches via a **NetBeans modal diff dialog** for secure, explicit user approval. | **Safe, auditable, and collaborative** code changes. |
| **Introspection** | Query Javadoc, source code, and class members for any type in your project or dependencies. | **Instant documentation** and deep code understanding without leaving the chat. |

### **Powered by the Gemini Java Client**

The Anahata AI Assistant is the premier showcase for the [**`gemini-java-client`**](https://github.com/anahata-os/gemini-java-client), our powerful, enterprise-ready library for integrating Google Gemini into any Java application. 

The client features a robust tool-calling framework, built-in Swing UI components, and a flexible configuration system. It is available under a dual-license model (AGPLv3 for open-source, commercial for proprietary use).
