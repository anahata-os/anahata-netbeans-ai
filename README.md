**Stop accepting "almost right." Demand an AI that truly understands your workspace.**

Anahata is an unprecedented, deeply integrated AI assistant for the Apache NetBeans IDE. It's more than a chatbot—it's a harmonious extension of your creative process, designed to bring flow and intelligence directly to your work.

## ✨ The "Deep Strike" Philosophy: Beyond Autocomplete

While other AI tools are just glorified autocomplete, Anahata is a true IDE partner. We win by executing a "Deep Strike" beyond surface-level code suggestions, targeting the core of the development workflow.

## 🧠 Intelligent Context Management: The AI's Memory

Anahata features a sophisticated, AI-driven **Prune-As-You-Go (PAYG)** algorithm. Unlike other assistants that hit a "token wall" and lose their memory, Anahata dynamically manages its context window in real-time.

-   **"What does this legacy class do?"** Anahata reads the class, its Javadoc, and its usages for a full summary.
-   **"Refactor this method and rename all its usages."** Safe, programmatic updates across your entire project.
-   **"Add a dependency for JUnit 5 and run the tests."** Maven management without leaving the chat.
-   **"Find the root cause of this NPE in the logs."** Direct integration with the Output Window and IDE logs.
-   **"Turn on the radio."** Enjoy your favorite internet radio stations while you code.
