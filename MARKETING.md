# Anahata AI Assistant - Marketing & Promotion Plan

This document outlines a plan for promoting the Anahata AI Assistant plugin for Apache NetBeans.

## 1. Core Message & Branding

- **Name:** Anahata AI Assistant
- **Tagline:** Code from the Heart.
- **Core Concept:** Anahata is not just a tool, but a development partner. It's deeply integrated into the NetBeans IDE to create a harmonious, intuitive, and intelligent coding workflow.
- **Keywords:** NetBeans, Java, AI Assistant, Google Gemini, Developer Productivity, IDE Integration.

## 2. Target Audience

- Primary: Existing Apache NetBeans users (Java developers, enterprise developers).
- Secondary: Java developers who may be using other IDEs but are interested in powerful AI tooling.

## 3. Promotional Channels & Content

### A. GitHub Repository

The project's `README.md` and `pom.xml` have already been updated to reflect the new branding and provide a clear, compelling overview of the plugin's philosophy and features. This is the central hub for all information.

### B. Social Media (Drafts for you to post)

> **Title:** Introducing the Anahata AI Assistant: A New Era of Development in Apache NetBeans
>
> Are you tired of AI assistants that feel like a disconnected chatbot in a sidebar?
>
> I'm excited to introduce the Anahata AI Assistant, a new open-source plugin for Apache NetBeans that redefines the relationship between developers and AI. Powered by Google Gemini, Anahata is not just an add-on; it's a deeply integrated partner with direct access to the IDE's core functionalities.

> **What makes Anahata different?**
>
> - **Deep Context Awareness:** It knows your open projects, active files, and even sees IDE errors and warnings in real-time.
> - **Direct IDE Interaction:** You can instruct it to perform actions like 'build project' or 'run file', and it will execute them.
> - **Full Project Comprehension:** By reading your source files, it builds a true understanding of your codebase for more accurate and insightful assistance.
>
> Our philosophy is "Code from the Heart." We aim to create a seamless, intuitive workflow where the AI works in harmony with you, helping you stay in the creative flow.
>
> Check out the project on GitHub to learn more and try it out. We welcome feedback and contributions!

### C. Community Forums (Draft for you to post)

**Platform: Reddit (Subreddits: r/java, r/netbeans)**

> **Title:** I built an AI assistant that is deeply integrated into the NetBeans IDE
>
> Hey everyone,
>
> I wanted to share an open-source project I've been working on: the Anahata AI Assistant for Apache NetBeans.
>
> I've always felt that most AI coding assistants lack true context. They don't really *understand* your workspace. To solve this, I built a plugin that gives the AI (Google Gemini) direct, programmatic access to the IDE itself.
>
> On every single request, the assistant knows:
> - All your open projects and their file structures.
> - Which files are currently open in the editor.
> - A complete list of IDE errors and warnings.
>
> This allows it to do some cool things, like building a project, reading a file, or reasoning about compilation errors with a simple natural language instruction.
>
> The project is named "Anahata" (the heart chakra) to reflect the goal of creating a more harmonious and intuitive coding experience.
>
> It's still early days, but I'd love for the community to check it out, give feedback, or even contribute.
>
> You can find the source code and more details here: [Link to GitHub Repo]
>
> Thanks for taking a look!
