/**
 * This package contains experimental, non-functional placeholder classes for a
 * future integration with a custom, native NetBeans Version Control System (VCS).
 *
 * <h2>Goal:</h2>
 * The long-term vision, as outlined in the main {@code anahata.md} file, is to
 * explore using a native VCS to track changes to files that are part of the AI's
 * active context. This could provide a more robust and efficient alternative to
 * the current {@code StatefulResource} tracking mechanism, leveraging the IDE's
 * own file status and event systems.
 *
 * <h2>Current Status:</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link uno.anahata.ai.nb.vcs.AnahataContextVCS}: A placeholder
 *       {@code VersioningSystem} registration.</li>
 *   <li>{@link uno.anahata.ai.nb.vcs.AnahataContextAnnotator}: A placeholder
 *       {@code VCSAnnotator} intended to provide visual feedback in the UI.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> The classes in this package are not currently active or compiled,
 * and represent a proof-of-concept for a future development effort.
